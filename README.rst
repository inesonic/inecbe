The inecbe library provides a wrapper around the CLANG, LLVM, and LLD
libraries.  The library also has facilites for launching LLD and similar
linkers as separate processes (distinct executable).

The library is built on the Qt framework so it's ideally suited for use wth
larger Qt based applications and is currently used as part of the *Aion*
application.
